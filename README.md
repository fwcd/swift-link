# Swift Link

A high-level Ableton Link library wrapper for Swift.

Wraps the binary [LinkKit](https://github.com/Ableton/LinkKit) framework on iOS (e.g. for App Store builds) and the cross-platform, GPL-licensed [Link](https://github.com/Ableton/link) library on other platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan on using this library, you should make sure that your project's license is compatible with the [LinkKit license](https://github.com/Ableton/LinkKit/blob/master/LICENSE.md) when building for iOS or the [Link license](https://github.com/Ableton/link/blob/master/LICENSE.md) when building for other platforms. The MIT license in this repo _only_ applies to the Swift wrapper itself.
